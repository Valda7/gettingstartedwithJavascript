• Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
Statically typed and dynamically typed are two different type systems used in programming languages. The main difference between them is when the type of a variable is checked by the compiler or interpreter.

In a statically typed language, the type of a variable is checked at compile time. This means that the type of a variable must be explicitly declared and checked by the compiler before the program is executed. The type of a variable cannot be changed during runtime. Examples of statically typed languages include:

Java
C++
C#
TypeScript
Kotlin
In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked at runtime. This means that the type of a variable does not need to be explicitly declared and can change during runtime. The type of a variable is determined based on the value it is assigned. Examples of dynamically typed languages include:

JavaScript
Python
Ruby
PHP
Lua
One advantage of statically typed languages is that they can catch type-related errors at compile time, making it easier to identify and fix bugs before the program is executed. Statically typed languages are also generally considered to be more efficient because the types are known at compile time.

On the other hand, dynamically typed languages offer more flexibility and are generally easier to write and read. They can be more concise and expressive because type declarations are not required, which can make them faster to develop and iterate.

Ultimately, the choice between statically typed and dynamically typed languages depends on the needs and preferences of the developer and the project requirements.


• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;
null and undefined are both JavaScript data types that represent the absence of a value. However, they differ in their behavior and how they are used in JavaScript.

null is a value that represents a deliberate non-value or the absence of any object value. It is typically used to assign an empty or non-existent value to a variable. For example, you can assign a variable to null to indicate that it does not currently have a value. null is also used to explicitly release or remove the reference to an object.

On the other hand, undefined is a value that represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It can also occur when an object property is called but the property does not exist. In this case, the value is undefined because there is no value associated with the property.

In general, it's a good practice to avoid using null and undefined interchangeably, and to use them as intended based on their behavior and purpose.
